# QOSF-Screening-Task

Task 1 Statevector simulation of quantum circuits

For this task, you will implement a statevector simulator for quantum circuits from scratch. The goal is to demystify how to simulate a quantum computer and to demonstrate your familiarity with quantum circuits.

1) Naive simulation using matrix multiplication

Remember that  [1, 0] = |0> is the most common representation of the single-qubit zero state, and analogously [0, 1] = |1>. 

Most matrix representations of quantum gates you can find online follow this convention. For example, the X gate can be written as

X = 1  00   1  

Using the Kronecker product and the np.kron function in numpy (we are using it as an example, but you can use any library you want to), you can create a vector of length 2^n representing an n-qubit quantum state, and matrix representation of X, H, and CNOT gates. 

Hint: The single-qubit Identity matrix is

I = 0  11   0  

Define a quantum circuit consisting of these gates and apply the gates sequentially to the state vectorstatevector via matrix multiplication. 

Plot the runtime of your code as a function of the number of qubits. How many qubits can you simulate this way? 


2) Advanced simulation using tensor multiplication

Tensors are generalizations of vectors and matrices to any number of dimensions. Instead of representing an n-qubit state as a vector of length 2^n, it may be more natural to write it as an n-dimensional tensor of shape (2, 2, â€¦., 2). The transformations between these two representations are naturally possible via np.reshape and np.flatten.

Using tensor multiplication and the np.tensordot (or np.einsum) function, you can apply a gate to the quantum state by multiplying the 1- or 2-qubit matrices with the state tensor along the corresponding qubit axes.

Define a quantum circuit consisting of the 1- and 2-qubit matrix representations of X, H, CNOT (same as above) and apply them sequentially to the quantum state tensor via tensor multiplication.
Plot the runtime of your code as a function of the number of qubits. How many qubits can you simulate this way? Compare your results to subtask 1).
